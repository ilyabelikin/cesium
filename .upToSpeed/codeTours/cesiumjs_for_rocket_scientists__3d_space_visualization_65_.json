Let's explore how to use CesiumJS to create a realistic orbital simulation using time-dynamic data and interpolation.\n\nIn this example, we'll simulate a satellite in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO). We'll use the SampledPositionProperty to define the satellite's position over time, and the VelocityOrientationProperty to automatically orient the satellite along its velocity vector.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key components:\n\n1. SampledPositionProperty: This allows us to define the satellite's position at different time steps. CesiumJS will interpolate between these positions for smooth motion.\n\n2. VelocityOrientationProperty: This automatically orients our satellite model along its velocity vector, simulating proper attitude control.\n\n3. PolylineGlowMaterialProperty: This creates a glowing effect for the orbital path, making it visually striking and easy to follow.\n\n4.
